# Information Retrieval Project

This Information Retrieval (IR) project is designed to implement a search engine for retrieving relevant documents from a given collection. The project utilizes various techniques and algorithms to enable efficient and accurate information retrieval.

## Features

- Indexing: The project includes a module to build an index from the provided document collection. This index enables fast retrieval of documents based on query terms.
- Query Processing: The search engine supports query processing by accepting user queries and retrieving relevant documents based on the query terms.
- Ranking: The retrieved documents are ranked based on their relevance to the query. The ranking algorithm considers factors such as term frequency, document frequency, and other relevance metrics.
- Retrieval Models: The project supports multiple retrieval models, such as the vector space model, BM25, and language models. These models provide different approaches to measure document relevance and improve retrieval effectiveness.
- Evaluation: The project includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the implemented retrieval models. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure the effectiveness of the search engine.

## Installation

To set up and run the Information Retrieval project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IR-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd IR-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Prepare the document collection:

   - Place your document collection in a suitable format in the project directory.
   - Ensure that the documents are in a compatible format for indexing and retrieval.

5. Run the project:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. Follow the instructions provided by the project to perform various operations, such as indexing, querying, and evaluating the search engine.

## Usage

1. Launch the project and choose the desired operation, such as indexing, querying, or evaluation.
2. If indexing, provide the path to the document collection and configure any relevant indexing parameters.
3. If querying, enter the query terms and choose the retrieval model to use.
4. If evaluating, select the evaluation metric and provide the relevant information for evaluation, such as relevance judgments.
5. Observe the output of the chosen operation, such as retrieved documents, ranking scores, or evaluation results.
